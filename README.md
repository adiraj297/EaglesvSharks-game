 Commented out code.
 Dead functions.

 Incorrect class hierarchy.
 Duplicated code in classes and methods.
 Feature envy (see lecture on refactoring).
 Inappropriate intimacy (see lecture on refactoring.
 Vertical separation (see lecture on refactoring).
 Switch statements (use polymorphism wherever possible).
 Long parameter list in methods and interfaces (use encapsulation).
 
 # USE / ALLOW:
Readable and maintainable code.
Meaningful and consistent naming convention.
Low Coupling between classes.
High Cohesion in classes.
Consistent indentation and spacing.
Comments that add value above the source code e.g. explaining algorithms, dependencies or reasons for design choices
Javadoc for core interfaces/classes, especially where there is a boundary between implementation from different team
members.
