# The board Game
The task is to develop a two dimensional, turn based board game, which is to be based on the classic “board game” design where a two-dimensional board is composed of a number of smaller play segments (such as squares on a chess board or real estate properties on a monopoly board) and is presented in a graphical representation which will be a topographical (top down) view.
